## Labs

### Overall

Could introduce the shell, but then have everything (including shell commands) be done in an R (or Hydrogen) notebook.

### Sequence alignment lab:

* the composition questions (8-11) are not very well specified.  Need to ask students about what comparisions they should be making, what shuffling they should be doing etc.

* likewise for the B02310.10 questions, should the students shuffle to test the significance of the specific alignment they got or the chance of pulling something out of the data base?  maybe both, but right now is not clear.
