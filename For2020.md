Atom package git-control not needed

Libre office probably not needed

pre-install Git-it

Don't pre-concatenate A.thaliana chromosome files

Have clock set itself to Paciic time

Make sure bowtie2-build is linked into /usr/local/bin

## Labs

### Overall

Could introduce the shell, but then have everything (including shell commands) be done in an R (or Hydrogen) notebook.

Use bash instead of fish.  This makes Julin sad, but then we could run linux commands in .Rmd files.

### Sequence alignment lab:

* the composition questions (8-11) are not very well specified.  Need to ask students about what comparisions they should be making, what shuffling they should be doing etc.

* likewise for the B02310.10 questions, should the students shuffle to test the significance of the specific alignment they got or the chance of pulling something out of the data base?  maybe both, but right now is not clear.

### Assignment 3 / RIntro

The Q#s don't line up between the template and the lab.  fix this.

### Assignment 4 / Rice SNPs

split the template file into two files to match the two lab pages.  This hopefully will enforce not carrying all of the objects over from one part one to part two.

### Shiny Lab

Clarify what "two input types" means.  (should be e.g. slider and radio button)

### GO Lab

Uupdate slides to expand on GO terms (bio process, etc)

### network lab #1

Exercise 1 does not make sense.  either change so that shortest distance is used in hclust or change the question.

### network lab #2

create separate networks for most variable genes in NDP and DP, or something, and compare

## metagenomics

needs a general revamping because of qiime 2

start from raw reads

Q2: I am not convinced that our explanation of what the table is (# of OTUs) is correct.

Q4: make the plots easier to interpret.  the colors are too similar for the different phyla.  One option would be to filter the data to only keep abundant phyla.
