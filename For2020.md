## Labs

### Overall

Could introduce the shell, but then have everything (including shell commands) be done in an R (or Hydrogen) notebook.

Use bash instead of fish.  This makes Julin sad, but then we could run linux commands in .Rmd files.

### Sequence alignment lab:

* the composition questions (8-11) are not very well specified.  Need to ask students about what comparisions they should be making, what shuffling they should be doing etc.

* likewise for the B02310.10 questions, should the students shuffle to test the significance of the specific alignment they got or the chance of pulling something out of the data base?  maybe both, but right now is not clear.

### Assignment 3 / RIntro

The Q#s don't line up between the template and the lab.  fix this.

### Assignment 4 / Rice SNPs

split the template file into two files to match the two lab pages.  This hopefully will enforce not carrying all of the objects over from one part one to part two.

### Shiny Lab

Clarify what "two input types" means.  (should be e.g. slider and radio button)
